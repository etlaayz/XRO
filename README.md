 Extendable Relocatable Object:
 
 Designed to replace all the other object formats I use.
 Designed to accommodate any digital processor's size and addressing modes.

 Initially designed for my Homebrew-36 and Homebrew-64 (now the Emerald-64) processors but has been expanded to accommodate any digital processor type.
 
 It is still a work in process.
